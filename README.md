The Pain This Toolkit Solves

You've been here before:

😰 PostgreSQL queries are slow, but you don't know which ones are killing performance

😰 CPU is spiking, but you can't find the query causing high load

😰 Connections keep maxing out you suspect a connection pool leak but can't prove it

😰 The database feels slow but you have no PostgreSQL health check to confirm it

😰 You're searching how to optimize PostgreSQL performance at 2 AM while production burns

😰 Table bloat is growing, but you don't know which tables need VACUUM

😰 You fixed the incident but can't explain the root cause in the post-mortem

The problem isn't your skills. The problem is visibility.

You can't fix what you can't see. You can't optimize PostgreSQL performance without knowing what's broken.
